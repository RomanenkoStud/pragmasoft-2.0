While working on VYKE Dashboard, our aim was to provide an integrated access point to Vyke administration facilities. We used advantages ofÂ Atlassian Crowd. Crowd is a web-based single sign-on (SSO) tool that aims to simplify application provisioning and identity management. VYKE Dashboard is comprised of an administration console and an integration API where such web applications are integrated: JIRA, Confluence, etc.

Pragmasoft design studio provided sleek design to the Dashboard along with convenient customizable GUI, as well as provided HTML/CSS coding services within BlueprintCSS technology.
